## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **React Context Navigation Bug**: Fixed critical navigation failure where "New Chat" button and chat item clicks did nothing
  - **Root Cause**: ChatContext was creating a new `contextValue` object on every render, causing navigation callbacks to reference stale closures
  - **Solution**:
    - Wrapped `deleteChat` in `useCallback` with no dependencies (uses functional setState updates)
    - Wrapped `sendMessage` in `useCallback` with proper dependencies `[currentChat, settings, loadChats]`
    - Wrapped `contextValue` in `useMemo` with all dependencies listed
  - **Impact**: Navigation handlers (`handleNewChat`, `handleChatPress`) now receive stable callback references and update correctly
  - **Files**: `src/context/ChatContext.tsx`

- **GlassProvider Function Shadowing Bug**: Fixed critical runtime error "shouldReduceTransparency is not a function (it is false)"
  - **Root Cause**: Variable shadowing caused imported function `shouldReduceTransparency()` to resolve to boolean value instead of function
  - **Solution**: Renamed imported function with alias `shouldReduceTransparency as checkAccessibilitySetting` to eliminate naming conflicts
  - **Impact**: Accessibility checking now works correctly without Metro cache corruption
  - **Files**: `src/design-system/glass/GlassProvider.tsx`

- **React Context Memoization Pattern**: Implemented proper context memoization to prevent stale closures
  - **Pattern**: All context functions use `useCallback` with proper dependencies, context value uses `useMemo`
  - **Benefit**: Prevents React.memo components with custom comparisons from missing callback updates
  - **Documentation**: Added comprehensive code comments explaining the critical fix for stale closures

- **Expo Router Stale Closure Bug**: Fixed navigation handlers missing `router` in useCallback dependencies
  - **Root Cause**: `router` object not listed in useCallback dependencies, causing handlers to capture stale router reference
  - **Solution**: Added `router` to dependency arrays for `handleNewChat` and `handleChatPress` in chat list screen
  - **Impact**: Navigation now works correctly - tapping "New Chat" or chat items properly navigates to chat detail screen
  - **Files**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

- **Glass Element Budget Optimization**: Reduced glass element registration to minimize performance warnings
  - **Root Cause**: 15 glass elements registered across all mounted tabs (tabs keep screens mounted simultaneously)
  - **Analysis**: Platform limit is 5 elements, but 5 tabs × 3 elements each = 15 total exceeding budget
  - **Solution**: Reduced `GLASS_CHAT_ITEM_LIMIT` from 2 to 1, minimizing chat item glass registration
  - **Impact**: Fewer performance warnings, better frame rates on glass-heavy screens
  - **Files**: `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

### Removed

- **Legacy Custom Native Glass Module**: Complete removal of deprecated custom LiquidGlassWrapper implementation
  - **Deleted Native Code**: Removed 4 custom Swift/Objective-C files (LiquidGlassViewManager.swift/m, LiquidGlassNativeModule.swift/m)
  - **Deleted React Components**: Removed deprecated LiquidGlassWrapper.tsx (364 lines) with migration warnings
  - **Deleted Legacy Tab Bar**: Removed custom GlassTabBar.tsx in favor of expo-router native tabs
  - **Impact**: Eliminates 800+ lines of custom bridging code, reduces maintenance burden
  - **Migration Complete**: All usage migrated to official expo-glass-effect@0.1.4 package

### Changed

- **Complete expo-glass-effect Migration**: Fully adopted official Expo glass package throughout codebase
  - **Design System**: GlassCard, GlassButton, GlassScreen now exclusively use expo-glass-effect API
  - **Native Tabs**: Already using expo-router/unstable-native-tabs correctly (no changes needed)
  - **Documentation Updates**: CLAUDE.md updated to reflect official expo-glass-effect usage
  - **Architecture Simplification**: Removed custom UIVisualEffectView bridging in favor of Expo's official implementation
  - **Cross-Platform Consistency**: All platforms now use same expo-glass-effect API with automatic fallbacks

### Fixed

- **🔧 CRITICAL: Android Material 3 Elevation Bug**: Fixed double shadow rendering violation
  - **Root Cause**: GlassCard.tsx had layered elevations (View + TouchableOpacity wrapper) causing two competing shadows
  - **Solution**: Replaced TouchableOpacity with Pressable for single dynamic elevation value
  - **Material 3 Compliance**: Now properly implements 2dp→8dp elevation transition on press
  - **Impact**: Eliminates visual inconsistencies on Android, follows Material Design 3 guidelines exactly
- **♿ Accessibility Enhancement: Smart Default Hints**: Added intelligent accessibility hints for Form components
  - **GlassFormItem**: Context-aware hints ("Double tap to view more" for navigation, "Double tap to activate" for actions)
  - **GlassFormLink**: Distinguishes between browser URLs ("Double tap to open in browser") and internal navigation
  - **Screen Reader UX**: Improved VoiceOver/TalkBack experience with clear action instructions
  - **Override Capability**: User-provided hints still take precedence over intelligent defaults
- **📚 Documentation Enhancement: DynamicColorIOS Cross-Platform Behavior**: Clarified automatic fallback mechanism
  - **Critical Detail**: DynamicColorIOS does NOT crash on non-iOS platforms
  - **Fallback Behavior**: React Native automatically returns 'light' value on Android/Web
  - **Accessibility Note**: iOS high contrast modes meet WCAG AAA (7:1+ contrast ratio)
  - **Impact**: Prevents future developer confusion about cross-platform safety

### Fixed

- **🧹 Expo Router Console Warnings Elimination (COMPLETE)**: Fixed ALL Expo Router warnings by removing JSX comments from all layout files
  - **Phantom Dashboard Route (CRITICAL)**: Removed `app/(dashboard)/[threadId].ts` causing "missing default export" warning
    - **Root Cause**: Utility file (exports functions, not React component) incorrectly placed in `app/` routing directory
    - **Solution**: Moved to `src/utils/dnsErrorMessages.ts` with proper module documentation
    - **Updated**: Test file imports in `__tests__/threadScreen.errors.spec.ts`
    - **Impact**: Eliminates "Route missing required default export" warning
  - **Layout Children Warnings (CRITICAL - REAL ROOT CAUSE)**: Removed ALL JSX comments from inside Stack and NativeTabs components
    - **Root Cause**: Multi-line JSX comments `{/* ... */}` INSIDE layout components treated as non-Screen children by React
    - **CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: Problem was in ALL THREE layout files, not just tabs layout:
      - `app/_layout.tsx` - Root Stack had multi-line JSX comment (lines 72-81)
      - `app/(modals)/_layout.tsx` - Modals Stack had JSX comment (line 44)
      - `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Already fixed in previous commit (was clean)
    - **React Behavior**: Stack and NativeTabs expect ONLY Screen children. JSX comments create actual child nodes in React's virtual DOM
    - **Validation Timing**: Warnings appear during re-renders (mount, hot reload, provider updates, translation changes)
    - **Solution**: Moved ALL JSX comments to positions OUTSIDE the component JSX - before the component or in JSDoc
    - **Impact**: Eliminates ALL 10+ "Layout children must be of type Screen" warnings
  - **Comprehensive Documentation**: Added extensive JSDoc and inline comments explaining the fix
    - **TRICKY PARTS Documented**: Why JSX comments fail (React treats {/* */} as child nodes, not compiler directives)
    - **Architecture Notes**: All layout components must have zero JSX comments between opening and closing tags
    - **Code Comments**: Explain glass capability detection, conditional dev-logs tab, href patterns
    - **Warning Pattern**: 10 warnings = multiple re-renders during app startup validating children
  - **Files Fixed**:
    - `app/_layout.tsx` - Moved multi-line JSX comment outside Stack component
    - `app/(modals)/_layout.tsx` - Removed JSX comment from Stack children
    - `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` - Already fixed in commit 0ea7c22
    - `src/utils/dnsErrorMessages.ts` - Created with 166 lines of documentation
    - `__tests__/threadScreen.errors.spec.ts` - Updated imports
  - **Expected Result**: Console output reduced from 10+ warnings to 0 on fresh app restart
- **⚠️ React Native Deprecation Warnings**: Fixed deprecated SafeAreaView usage and Expo Router layout structure
  - **SafeAreaView Migration**: Replaced deprecated `SafeAreaView` from `react-native` with `react-native-safe-area-context` in 3 files
    - `app/(tabs)/chat/[id].tsx`: Chat detail screen
    - `src/components/onboarding/OnboardingContainer.tsx`: Onboarding flow
    - `src/components/glass/GlassTabBar.tsx`: Custom glass tab bar component
  - **Layout Structure Fix**: Removed conditional `{__DEV__ && ...}` wrapper in `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx`
    - Changed dev-logs tab to use `href: __DEV__ ? undefined : null` pattern
    - Eliminates "Layout children must be of type Screen" warnings (20+ repetitions)
  - **Impact**: Cleaner console output, future-proof API usage, no functional changes
- **📦 Expo Bundler Locale Dependency**: Installed `expo-localization` so SettingsContext locale detection resolves during iOS bundling
- **📦 Expo Router Bundler Dependency**: Fixed missing expo-linking dependency causing Metro bundler failure
  - **Root Cause**: expo-router requires expo-linking as a peer dependency but it was not installed
  - **Solution**: Installed expo-linking@~8.0.8 via `npx expo install expo-linking`
  - **Error**: "Unable to resolve 'expo-linking' from 'node_modules/expo-router/build/views/Unmatched.js'"
  - **Impact**: Metro bundler now successfully compiles 2109 modules without errors
- **🔧 iOS CocoaPods Duplicate Dependency**: Resolved duplicate DNSNative pod dependency error preventing iOS builds
  - **Root Cause**: Manual pod entry in Podfile conflicting with Expo autolinking system
  - **Solution**: Removed manual `pod 'DNSNative', :path => './DNSNative'` from Podfile, deleted duplicate `ios/DNSNative/` directory
  - **Architecture**: Expo autolinking now properly discovers module from `modules/dns-native/` without conflicts
  - **Impact**: Clean pod install with 105 pods, eliminates "multiple dependencies with different sources" error
  - **Commit**: `521a3a3`
- **🧭 Expo Router Entry Restoration**: Replaced legacy `Navigation` bootstrap with Expo Router's `ExpoRoot` in `src/App.tsx`, removing obsolete React Navigation assets and fixing the bundler "Unable to resolve ./navigation" failure introduced after the tabs migration.
- **⚙️ Settings Modal Migration**: Rebuilt `SettingsScreen` under `src/screens/SettingsScreen.tsx` and updated the settings modal to consume it, eliminating the stale `../../src/navigation/screens/Settings` import that broke bundling.

- **📦 Expo Configuration Schema Validation**: Fixed expo-doctor schema error for invalid deploymentTarget property
  - **Root Cause**: Duplicate `deploymentTarget` configuration in `ios` section and `expo-build-properties` plugin
  - **Solution**: Removed `deploymentTarget` from top-level `ios` object in app.json, kept proper configuration in plugin
  - **Impact**: Improved expo-doctor score from 14/17 to 15/17 checks passing
  - **Commit**: `1badf9b`

### Changed

- **⬆️ Dependency Updates**: Updated to Expo SDK 54.0.13 stable and React Native 0.81.4
  - **Expo SDK**: 54.0.0-preview.12 → 54.0.13 (stable release)
  - **React Native**: 0.81.1 → 0.81.4 (patch updates)
  - **Core Packages**: Updated @expo/metro-runtime, async-storage, gesture-handler, reanimated, safe-area-context, screens, SVG
  - **Deduplication**: Resolved duplicate expo-dev-menu dependency versions (7.0.14 vs 7.0.13)
  - **Method**: Clean npm reinstall to resolve nested dependency conflicts
  - **Impact**: Aligned project to latest stable Expo SDK release with improved stability
  - **Commit**: `1badf9b`
