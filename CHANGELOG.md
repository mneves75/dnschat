  - Fixed infinite React Native hot reload bundle rebuilds
  - Eliminated main thread blocking that triggered iOS 5-second timeout kills
  - Prevented circular dependency between SettingsContext and ChatContext
- **‚ö†Ô∏è MockDNSService Misuse**: Fixed inappropriate MockDNSService usage in onboarding screens
  - MockDNSService now disabled by default (users get real DNS behavior)
  - Added `enableMockDNS` setting in Settings context (default: false)
  - Onboarding screens explicitly use real DNS methods only
  - DNS fallback chain now respects MockDNSService setting properly

### Technical Improvements

- **Performance Optimization**: Eliminated useCallback dependency issues causing infinite loops
