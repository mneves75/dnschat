# Liquid Glass Tab Bar Recovery Plan

_Date:_ September 30, 2025

## Context & Findings
- The iOS tab bar now properly renders with blur effects on iOS 17+ using UIVisualEffectView for iOS 17-25 and SwiftUI .glassEffect() for iOS 26+.
- iOS 17+ devices now use UIVisualEffectView with proper blur effects, while iOS 26+ gets the full SwiftUI .glassEffect() API.
- `app/(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` correctly uses the new capability detection to enable glass effects on iOS 17+.
- Capability detection properly distinguishes between iOS 17+ (UIVisualEffectView blur) and iOS 26+ (SwiftUI .glassEffect()).

## Goals
1. Deliver a functioning blur-backed tab bar on current iOS releases while keeping room for future iOS 26+ enhancements.
2. Align TypeScript, native iOS code, and capability detection so "supported" means "we can render a native blur", while advanced SwiftUI-only affordances remain feature-flagged.
3. Eliminate invalid props/usages and add regression coverage to guard the behaviour matrix.

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

**iOS 17+ Blur Effects Successfully Implemented:**

- ✅ **Corrected Version Detection**: Native module now properly reports iOS 17+ as supporting blur effects (`supportsBasicBlur: true`) while iOS 26+ supports SwiftUI glass effects (`supportsSwiftUIGlass: true`)
- ✅ **UIVisualEffectView Integration**: Added `UIBlurEffectView` class that provides proper UIVisualEffectView blur effects for iOS 17-25
- ✅ **SwiftUI .glassEffect() Support**: Maintained full SwiftUI .glassEffect() support for iOS 26+ with sensor awareness and dynamic intensity
- ✅ **Updated Capability Detection**: React Native hooks now properly handle the corrected capability structure with separate flags for basic blur vs SwiftUI glass effects
- ✅ **Tab Bar Integration**: Tab layout now correctly enables glass effects on iOS 17+ using the appropriate native views

## Verification
- Run the focused Jest suite (`npm test -- liquidGlass`) after adjustments.
- Attempt a TypeScript pass (`npm run typecheck`) to surface regressions (project currently reports missing `expo-router/entry` types in this environment).
