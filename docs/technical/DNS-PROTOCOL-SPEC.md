Sending a DNS message like "dig @ch.at \"what is the meaning of life?\" TXT +short" in React Native is more complex than in a server-side environment or a native platform with dedicated DNS libraries. There isn't a single, high-level library in React Native that allows for specifying a custom DNS server and performing a TXT record lookup in one go.

However, you can achieve this by combining two types of libraries:

1.  A DNS packet library to create the raw DNS query.
2.  A UDP (User Datagram Protocol) socket library to send the raw query to the DNS server.

For this, we can use `react-native-dns-packet` to construct the DNS query and `react-native-udp` to handle the network communication.

### Technical Details:

1.  **Dependency Installation:** You'll need to add `react-native-dns-packet` and `react-native-udp` to your project.
2.  **DNS Packet Creation:** The `react-native-dns-packet` library allows you to create a DNS query packet. You'll specify the query type as 'TXT' and provide the domain name you want to query ("what is the meaning of life?").
3.  **UDP Socket Communication:** Since DNS queries are typically sent over UDP, you'll use `react-native-udp` to create a UDP socket. This socket will be used to send the DNS query packet to the custom DNS server (`ch.at`) on port 53 (the standard DNS port).
4.  **Sending and Receiving Data:** You'll send the created DNS packet as a Buffer over the UDP socket. The socket will then listen for an incoming message, which will be the DNS response from the server.
5.  **Response Decoding:** Once you receive the response, you'll use `react-native-dns-packet` again to decode the raw buffer into a readable JavaScript object. This object will contain the TXT record information.

### React Native Code Example:

Here's a code snippet that demonstrates how to perform the DNS query.

First, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install react-native-dns-packet react-native-udp
```

Then, link the native modules for `react-native-udp`:

```bash
react-native link react-native-udp
```

Now, you can use the following code in your React Native component:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import dgram from 'react-native-udp';
import { encode, decode } from 'react-native-dns-packet';

const DnsQueryComponent = () => {

  const queryDns = () => {
    const socket = dgram.createSocket('udp4');

    const dnsQuery = {
      type: 'query',
      id: 1,
      flags: 256, // Standard query
      questions: [{
        type: 'TXT',
        name: 'what is the meaning of life?'
      }]
    };

    const queryBuffer = encode(dnsQuery);

    socket.on('message', (msg, rinfo) => {
      const decodedResponse = decode(msg);
      console.log('Received from server:', decodedResponse);
      // You can now access the TXT record from the decodedResponse.answers array
      if (decodedResponse.answers && decodedResponse.answers.length > 0) {
        const txtRecord = decodedResponse.answers[0].data;
        console.log('TXT Record:', txtRecord.toString());
      }
      socket.close();
    });

    socket.send(queryBuffer, 0, queryBuffer.length, 53, 'ch.at', (err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error sending packet:', err);
        socket.close();
      }
    });
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Button title="Query DNS for Meaning of Life" onPress={queryDns} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default DnsQueryComponent;```

This React Native component provides a button that, when pressed, will send the DNS query and print the response to the console. This method gives you low-level control over the DNS query process, allowing you to replicate the `dig` command's functionality.
