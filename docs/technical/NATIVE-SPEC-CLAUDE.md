## Native DNS TXT Implementation Specification for iOS and Android

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Both iOS and Android implementations deployed and tested
**Target**: Implement direct DNS TXT queries to `ch.at` using native mobile APIs
**Goal**: Bypass platform restrictions while maintaining security and performance
**Result**: Production-ready native implementations with comprehensive fallback strategies

---

## 1. PROBLEM ANALYSIS

### Current Failure Points

1. **iOS Port Blocking**: `ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT` when attempting UDP to port 53
2. **DNS-over-HTTPS Encoding**: `base64url` encoding errors in Cloudflare API calls
3. **Platform Restrictions**: Mobile sandboxes prevent raw socket access to privileged ports
4. **Query Format Mismatch**: Current implementation may not match what `ch.at` expects

### Working Reference: test-dns-simple.js

- Uses Node.js native DNS resolver (`dns.resolve()`)
- Leverages system DNS configuration and routing
- Properly formats DNS packets via libc resolver
- Has elevated privileges compared to mobile apps

### Critical Technical Insight

**The core issue isn't DNS protocol complexity - it's platform security models preventing direct port 53 access. We must work WITH platform APIs, not against them.**

---

## 2. NATIVE API RESEARCH & SELECTION

### iOS: Network Framework Approach (iOS 12+)

**Primary Solution**: Use Apple's Network Framework - the modern, sanctioned approach

```c
// Key APIs to implement:
nw_resolver_t nw_resolver_create(nw_resolver_config_t config);
nw_resolver_query(resolver, hostname, type, class, callback);
```

**Advantages**:

- Apple-approved API that works within iOS security model
- Supports custom DNS servers and TXT queries
- Handles network changes and failures gracefully
- Available on all supported iOS versions

**Implementation Strategy**:

- Create `DNSResolver` Objective-C class wrapping Network Framework
- Use `nw_resolver_create()` with custom config pointing to `ch.at:53`
- Query TXT records using `nw_resolver_query()` with proper callbacks
- Bridge to React Native via `RCTPromiseResolveBlock`

### Android: Multi-API Approach

**Primary (API 29+)**: DnsResolver API

```java
DnsResolver.getInstance().query(network, domain, type,
    executor, cancellationSignal, callback);
```

**Fallback (API <29)**: dnsjava Library

```java
Lookup lookup = new Lookup(domain, Type.TXT);
lookup.setResolver(new SimpleResolver("ch.at"));
Record[] records = lookup.run();
```

**Advantages**:

- DnsResolver is Android's modern, official DNS API
- dnsjava provides full DNS control for older devices
- Both can specify custom DNS servers
- Proper TXT record parsing built-in

## 3. ARCHITECTURE DESIGN

### Native Module Structure

```
ios/
├── RNDNSModule.h              # Public interface
├── RNDNSModule.m              # React Native bridge
├── DNSResolver.h              # Core DNS functionality
├── DNSResolver.m              # Network Framework implementation
└── RNDNSModule.podspec        # CocoaPods specification

android/
├── RNDNSModule.java           # React Native bridge
├── DNSResolver.java           # Core DNS functionality
├── DNSPackage.java            # Package registration
└── build.gradle               # Dependencies (dnsjava)
```

### JavaScript Interface Design

```typescript
interface NativeDNSModule {
  queryTXT(domain: string, message: string): Promise<string[]>;
  isAvailable(): Promise<boolean>;
  getCapabilities(): Promise<DNSCapabilities>;
}

interface DNSCapabilities {
  supportsCustomServer: boolean;
  supportsAsyncQuery: boolean;
  platform: "ios" | "android";
  apiLevel?: number; // Android only
}
```

### Error Handling Strategy

```typescript
enum DNSErrorType {
  PLATFORM_UNSUPPORTED = "PLATFORM_UNSUPPORTED",
  NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE = "NETWORK_UNAVAILABLE",
  DNS_SERVER_UNREACHABLE = "DNS_SERVER_UNREACHABLE",
  INVALID_RESPONSE = "INVALID_RESPONSE",
  TIMEOUT = "TIMEOUT",
  PERMISSION_DENIED = "PERMISSION_DENIED",
}
```

## 4. IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

**Objective**: Basic native module scaffolding and capability detection

**iOS Tasks**:

- Create Objective-C module with Network Framework imports
- Implement basic TXT query using `nw_resolver_query()`
- Add React Native bridge methods (`queryTXT`, `isAvailable`)
- Test against known public DNS servers (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)

**Android Tasks**:

- Create Java module with DnsResolver imports
- Implement API level detection and capability reporting
- Add dnsjava dependency for fallback support
- Create unified interface abstracting both APIs

**Deliverables**:

- Native modules compile and link successfully
- JavaScript can detect platform DNS capabilities
- Basic TXT queries work against public DNS servers

### Phase 2: ch.at Integration (Week 2)

**Objective**: Establish working communication with target LLM service

**Critical Investigation**:

- Analyze `test-dns.js` network traffic using tcpdump/Wireshark
- Identify exact DNS packet structure that works
- Compare with mobile app packet captures
- Document any differences in query format, flags, or encoding

**Implementation**:

- Configure native modules to query `ch.at:53` specifically
- Implement message encoding that matches working CLI tool
- Add multi-part TXT response parsing ("1/3:", "2/3:" format)
- Comprehensive error logging for debugging

**Validation**:

- Native modules can reach `ch.at`
- TXT responses are properly parsed and concatenated
- Error rates comparable to CLI tool

### Phase 3: React Native Integration (Week 3)

**Objective**: Seamless integration with existing chat application

**TypeScript Integration**:

- Create type definitions for native DNS module
- Update `DNSService` to use native implementation as primary
- Maintain existing fallback chain: Native → DoH → Mock
- Add platform capability detection and smart routing

**Error Handling & UX**:

- Map native errors to user-friendly messages
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Add network connectivity monitoring
- Graceful degradation when native DNS unavailable

**Performance Optimization**:

- Connection pooling for DNS resolver instances
- Request deduplication for identical queries
- Background query cancellation on screen changes
- Memory management for long-running resolvers

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Week 4)

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing across devices and network conditions

**Device Testing Matrix**:

- iOS: iPhone 12+, iPad, various iOS versions (15.0+)
- Android: Pixel, Samsung, OnePlus, various API levels (23+)
- Network conditions: WiFi, cellular, VPN, restricted networks

**Automated Testing**:

- Unit tests for DNS parsing logic
- Integration tests against mock DNS servers
- E2E tests with actual `ch.at` queries
- Performance benchmarks vs existing implementations

**Edge Case Validation**:

- Network interruption during queries
- DNS server unavailability
- Malformed responses from LLM service
- Concurrent query handling
- App backgrounding/foregrounding behavior

---

## 5. ALTERNATIVE SOLUTIONS (If Native APIs Fail)

### Option A: HTTP Proxy Service

**Architecture**: Deploy custom HTTP service that performs DNS queries server-side

```typescript
// Service Endpoint Design
POST https://dns-proxy.dnschat.app/query
{
  "server": "ch.at",
  "query": "Hello world",
  "type": "TXT"
}

// Response Format
{
  "success": true,
  "records": ["1/2:Hello! I'm an AI", "2/2: assistant..."],
  "responseTime": 245
}
```

**Implementation Requirements**:

- Lightweight Node.js service using `dns.resolve()`
- Deploy on Vercel/Netlify for low latency
- Rate limiting and authentication
- Fallback DNS servers for redundancy

### Option B: DNS over HTTPS Fix

**Problem**: Current base64url encoding errors in Cloudflare API

**Solution**: Implement RFC 8484 compliant DoH queries

```typescript
// Proper DoH implementation
const dnsQuery = encodeDNSPacket(domain, "TXT");
const base64Query = btoa(String.fromCharCode(...dnsQuery))
  .replace(/\+/g, "-")
  .replace(/\//g, "_")
  .replace(/=/g, "");

const response = await fetch(
  `https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?dns=${base64Query}`,
  {
    headers: { Accept: "application/dns-message" },
  },
);
```

### Option C: Alternative Transport Protocols

**Investigation**: Does `ch.at` support:

- DNS over TCP (port 53) - might bypass UDP restrictions
- DNS over TLS (port 853) - better mobile support
- DNS over HTTPS (port 443) - universal support
- HTTP-based query interface - custom protocol
