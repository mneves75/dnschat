**Status:** 游댮 BLOCKING - Do not ship without addressing P0 issues
**Created:** 2025-09-30
**Target:** Complete all P0 fixes within 1 week

## 游댮 Phase 1: Critical Fixes (THIS WEEK)

### P0-1: Fix Race Condition in Key Generation 丘멆잺 DATA CORRUPTION RISK
**File:** `src/utils/encryption.ts:267-284`
**Estimated Time:** 4 hours
**Blocker:** YES

- [ ] Add `keyGenerationLocks` Map to track in-progress key generation
- [ ] Implement `generateConversationKey()` with mutex locking
- [ ] Extract implementation to `_generateConversationKeyImpl()`
- [ ] Add double-check after acquiring lock
- [ ] Write regression test for concurrent key generation
- [ ] Test with 10+ concurrent calls to same conversation ID

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Multiple concurrent calls to `generateConversationKey('same-id')` produce identical keys
- No keys are overwritten
- All encrypted data remains decryptable

---

### P0-2: Fix Race Condition in Master Password 丘멆잺 CATASTROPHIC RISK
**File:** `src/utils/encryption.ts:290-300`
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Blocker:** YES

- [ ] Add `masterPasswordPromise` static field
- [ ] Cache first master password creation promise
- [ ] Ensure all subsequent calls wait for same promise
- [ ] Never clear the promise (master password is stable)
- [ ] Write test for concurrent master password access
- [ ] Test with 100+ concurrent calls at app startup

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Only one master password ever created
- All conversations use the same master password
- Concurrent access returns same password

---

### P0-3: Implement Key Cleanup on Chat Deletion 丘멆잺 SECURITY VIOLATION
**File:** `src/services/storageService.ts:367-376`
**Estimated Time:** 1 hour
**Blocker:** YES (GDPR/compliance)

- [ ] Add `await EncryptionService.deleteConversationKey(chatId)` to `deleteChat()`
- [ ] Add error handling and logging
- [ ] Write test verifying key is removed after chat deletion
- [ ] Test that deleted keys cannot decrypt old backups
- [ ] Add audit logging for key deletion

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Deleting chat removes encryption key from Keychain
- `isConversationEncrypted(deletedChatId)` returns false
- No orphaned keys remain in Keychain

---

### P0-4: Implement Key Recovery Mechanism 丘멆잺 DATA LOSS RISK
**File:** `src/utils/encryption.ts` (new functionality)
**Estimated Time:** 8 hours
**Blocker:** YES (user data loss)

**Choose One Approach:**

#### Option A: User-Exportable Backup (RECOMMENDED)
- [ ] Implement `exportRecoveryBundle(userPassword: string): Promise<string>`
- [ ] Implement `importRecoveryBundle(bundle: string, userPassword: string): Promise<void>`
- [ ] Add UI for exporting recovery bundle (Settings screen)
- [ ] Add UI for importing recovery bundle (first launch after restore)
- [ ] Store recovery bundle version number
- [ ] Write tests for export/import flow
- [ ] Add warning: "Without this, you'll lose all chats on device restore"

#### Option B: Cloud Keychain Sync (iOS Only)
- [ ] Change `accessible` to `WHEN_UNLOCKED` (remove `THIS_DEVICE_ONLY`)
- [ ] Add `synchronizable: true` to Keychain options
- [ ] Test with iCloud Keychain enabled/disabled
- [ ] Add Android alternative (Firebase/CloudStore)
- [ ] Write tests for sync flow

#### Option C: Encrypted Cloud Backup (Cross-Platform)
- [ ] Set up Firebase/CloudStore for key backup
- [ ] Encrypt master password with device-specific key
- [ ] Implement automatic backup on key creation
- [ ] Implement automatic restore on app launch
- [ ] Add privacy policy disclosure
- [ ] Write tests for cloud backup/restore

**Acceptance Criteria (Option A):**
- User can export recovery bundle
- Recovery bundle is valid JSON with version number
- User can import bundle on new device and decrypt all chats
- Invalid password shows clear error message
- Missing recovery bundle shows clear warning

---

### P0-5: Add Safe JSON Parsing with Validation 丘멆잺 CRASH RISK
**File:** `src/utils/encryption.ts:429`
**Estimated Time:** 2 hours
**Blocker:** YES

- [ ] Wrap `JSON.parse()` in try-catch
- [ ] Validate parsed structure (has `salt` and `key` arrays)
- [ ] Log corruption errors with conversation ID
- [ ] Remove corrupted key and return null
- [ ] Add regeneration logic (with user warning)
- [ ] Write test with malformed JSON
- [ ] Write test with invalid structure (missing salt/key)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Malformed JSON doesn't crash app
- Invalid structure is detected and logged
- User sees warning about data corruption
- App continues to function with graceful degradation

## Risk Mitigation

### If P0 Fixes Cannot Be Completed in 1 Week
- **Temporary Fix:** Add global lock around all encryption operations
- **Impact:** Performance degradation, but prevents data corruption
- **Code:**
  ```typescript
  private static globalEncryptionLock = Promise.resolve();

  static async withLock<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    const current = this.globalEncryptionLock;
    let resolver: () => void;
    this.globalEncryptionLock = new Promise(resolve => resolver = resolve);

    try {
      await current;
      return await fn();
    } finally {
      resolver!();
    }
  }
  ```

### If Key Recovery Cannot Be Implemented
- **Fallback:** Disable encryption entirely (LAST RESORT)
- **Migration:** Decrypt all data, remove encryption, store plaintext
- **Warning:** Add prominent banner: "Encryption temporarily disabled"
