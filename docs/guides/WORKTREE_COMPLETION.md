## ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of Using Git Worktrees

1. **Isolated Development**: Fixed Android issues without disrupting main work
2. **Parallel Development**: Could work on About page while build was testing
3. **Clean History**: Separate commits for different features
4. **Safe Testing**: Validated changes before merging to main
5. **No Context Switching**: Maintained separate working directories

The worktree approach allowed us to safely experiment with Android build fixes while simultaneously developing the About page features, demonstrating the power of git worktrees for complex development tasks.
