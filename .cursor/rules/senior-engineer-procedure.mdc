### Senior Engineer Task Execution

1. Clarify Scope First
   - Confirm the objective, constraints, and outputs before coding
   - Propose a minimal plan and list of affected files
2. Locate Exact Code Insertion Point
   - Identify precise files/lines; justify each file
   - Avoid sweeping edits or refactors unless requested
3. Minimal, Contained Changes
   - Implement only whatâ€™s required; avoid speculative edits
   - Isolate logic to prevent regressions
4. Double Check Everything
   - Verify correctness, security, and downstream effects
   - Align with existing patterns and platform constraints
5. Deliver Clearly
   - Summarize changes, list modified files, note assumptions/risks
