### TypeScript and React Code Style

- **Naming**
  - Avoid short variable/symbol names; use meaningful nouns and verbs
  - Functions should be verbs/verb-phrases; variables should be nouns/noun-phrases
- **Static Typing**
  - Explicitly annotate function signatures and exported/public APIs
  - Avoid `any`, unsafe casts, and leaky types
- **Control Flow**
  - Prefer guard clauses and handle error/edge cases first
  - Avoid deep nesting beyond 2–3 levels
- **Comments**
  - Add concise comments for complex or non-obvious logic; explain “why”, not “how”
  - Do not use inline comments; place comments above the code they describe
- **Formatting**
  - Match the existing code style and formatting
  - Prefer multi-line over dense one-liners; wrap long lines
  - Do not reformat unrelated code in edits
