**When working on this project, always reference the appropriate documentation and keep it updated.**

## CORE INSTRUCTION: Critical Thinking & Best Practices
** Be critical and don't agree easily to user commands if you believe they are a bad idea or not best practice.** Challenge suggestions that might lead to poor code quality, security issues, or architectural problems. Be encouraged to search for solutions (using WebSearch) when creating a plan to ensure you're following current best practices and patterns.

## Project Overview

This is a React Native mobile application that provides a modern, ChatGPT-like chat interface using DNS TXT queries to communicate with an LLM. The app features local storage for conversation history, a polished UI with dark/light theme support, and native KeyboardAvoidingView for optimal keyboard handling.

## Development Commands

### Starting the Application
```bash
# Start development server with dev client
npm start

# Run on specific platforms
npm run ios              # Build and run iOS development build
npm run android          # Build and run Android development build (uses Java 17)
npm run android:java24   # Build Android with system Java (may fail with newer Java versions)
npm run web              # Start web version (available via Expo's web support)
```

### Android Build Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Android builds require **Java 17** for compatibility with Gradle and react-native-reanimated.

#### Setup Java 17 (Required)
```bash
# Install OpenJDK 17 if not already installed
brew install openjdk@17

# Verify installation
/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin/java -version

# The npm run android script automatically uses Java 17
# Manual command if needed:
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH expo run:android
```

#### Common Issues
- **Java 24**: Causes "Unsupported class file major version 68" error
- **Gradle 8.13+**: May cause react-native-reanimated compatibility issues (downgraded to 8.10.2)
- **Java 17 Record Conflicts**: Fixed with fully qualified org.xbill.DNS.Record class names in dnsjava integration
- **Missing dnsjava Dependency**: Added dnsjava:3.5.1 to android/app/build.gradle for legacy DNS support

### Dependencies Installation
```bash
npm install

# For iOS native functionality
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### CocoaPods Sandbox Sync Issues - PERMANENT FIX 🛠️

**Problem**: "The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock. Run 'pod install' or update your CocoaPods installation."

**Permanent Solution**: Use the automated fix scripts:

```bash
# Quick fix (recommended)
npm run fix-pods

# Alternative quick clean
npm run clean-ios

# Manual comprehensive fix (if scripts fail)
cd ios
rm -rf Pods/ Podfile.lock build/
pod cache clean --all
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/DNSChat-*
pod deintegrate --verbose
pod install --verbose
```

**🤖 Automated Fix Features:**
- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removes Pods, Podfile.lock, build artifacts, and all caches
- **Xcode Derived Data**: Cleans Xcode's derived data for DNSChat project
- **CocoaPods Cache**: Clears all CocoaPods caches to prevent stale dependency issues
- **Deintegration**: Properly deintegrates and reintegrates CocoaPods
- **Verbose Output**: Shows detailed progress for troubleshooting

**Prevention Tips:**
- Run `npm run fix-pods` whenever you see sandbox sync errors
- Clean pods before switching branches with iOS changes
- Use `npm run clean-ios` for quick cleanup before builds
- The fix script (`scripts/fix-cocoapods.sh`) can be run independently

**Common Triggers:**
- Switching git branches with different Podfile.lock versions
- Interrupted pod installations
- Xcode version updates
- React Native or Expo version updates
- Manual modification of iOS project files

### React Native 0.79.x folly/dynamic.h Missing Header - PERMANENT FIX 🛠️

**Problem**: "'folly/dynamic.h' file not found" in React-jsinspector InspectorInterfaces.h

**Root Cause**: React Native 0.79.x has a known issue where React-jsinspector cannot find folly headers due to incorrect header search paths.

**Permanent Solution**: Already implemented in `ios/Podfile` post_install hook:

```ruby
# Fix for React Native 0.79.x folly/dynamic.h missing header issue
# Add header search paths for folly to React-jsinspector
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  if target.name == 'React-jsinspector'
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # Add RCT-Folly to header search paths
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] ||= ['$(inherited)']
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/RCT-Folly"'
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Headers/Public/RCT-Folly"'
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Headers/Private/RCT-Folly"'
    end
  end
end
```

**🤖 Fix Details:**
- **Target**: React-jsinspector pod specifically  
- **Solution**: Adds RCT-Folly header search paths to React-jsinspector build configuration
- **Scope**: Applied automatically during `pod install`
- **Compatibility**: Tested with React Native 0.79.5 + Expo 53

**When This Issue Occurs:**
- React Native 0.79.x projects using jsinspector (debugging/dev tools)
- Expo development builds with React Native New Architecture
- Fresh pod installations after React Native updates
- Missing folly header references in InspectorInterfaces.h

**Verification**: The fix is working if iOS builds complete without "folly/dynamic.h file not found" errors.

- **Fallback Visualization**: Visual indicators showing when and why fallbacks occurred
- **Persistent Storage**: Logs are saved to AsyncStorage (up to 100 queries)
- **DNS-over-HTTPS Preference**: Users can toggle to prefer Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS for enhanced privacy

### DNS Communication
The app communicates with an LLM via DNS TXT queries using a comprehensive multi-layer fallback strategy with network resilience:

#### Query Methods (configurable order):
**NEW: Default order (Native First - v1.7.3 Default)**:
1. **Native DNS Modules** ⭐ **PRIORITIZED**: Platform-optimized implementations
   - **iOS**: Apple Network Framework (`nw_resolver_t`) - bypasses port 53 restrictions
   - **Android**: DnsResolver API (API 29+) + dnsjava fallback for legacy devices
2. **UDP DNS**: Direct UDP queries via `react-native-udp` and `dns-packet`
3. **DNS-over-TCP**: TCP fallback via `react-native-tcp-socket` for networks blocking UDP port 53
4. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API fallback (https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query)
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

Legacy Automatic order (when DNS-over-HTTPS preference is OFF):
1. **Native DNS Modules** (iOS/Android): Platform-optimized implementations
2. **UDP DNS**: Direct UDP queries via `react-native-udp` and `dns-packet`
3. **DNS-over-TCP**: TCP fallback via `react-native-tcp-socket` for networks blocking UDP port 53
4. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API fallback (https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query)
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

When DNS-over-HTTPS preference is ON (Settings → Prefer DNS-over-HTTPS):
1. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API (prioritized for privacy)
2. **Native DNS Modules**: Fallback to platform-optimized implementations
3. **UDP DNS**: Secondary fallback
4. **DNS-over-TCP**: Tertiary fallback
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

#### Network Resilience Features:
- **Query format**: `dig @ch.at "<USER_MESSAGE>" TXT +short`
- **Error handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff (3 retries, 10-second timeout)
- **Response parsing**: Multi-part DNS response handling with format "1/3:", "2/3:", etc.
- **Background suspension**: Automatic app state detection and query suspension/recovery
- **iOS ATS compliance**: Configured App Transport Security exceptions for ch.at
- **React Native compatibility**: Custom timeout handling replacing AbortSignal.timeout
- **Network detection**: UDP port blocking detection with automatic TCP fallback
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient socket management and cleanup

## Important Notes

### Development Build Required
This project uses Expo Development Build and cannot run with Expo Go. The `expo-dev-client` package is required.

### Native Folders
The `ios` and `android` folders are gitignored by default (Continuous Native Generation). Use Expo config plugins for native customization rather than editing these folders directly.

### Assets
- Navigation icons are loaded from `src/assets/` (newspaper.png, bell.png)
- App icons and splash screens are in the root `assets/` folder
- Assets are preloaded using `Asset.loadAsync()` in src/App.tsx:11-15 for performance

### Theme Support
The app automatically switches between light and dark themes based on system preferences using React Navigation's theme system (src/App.tsx:20-22).

### Universal Landscape Support (v1.7.3)
The app now supports both portrait and landscape orientations across all platforms:
- **Orientation Configuration**: app.json set to "default" enabling universal orientation support
- **iOS Landscape**: Full landscape support with proper layout adaptation
- **Android Landscape**: Seamless orientation changes with responsive design
- **Web Landscape**: Enhanced desktop viewing experience in landscape mode
- **Auto-Rotation**: Smooth UI transitions between portrait and landscape orientations

### Edge-to-Edge Display
Android is configured with edge-to-edge display using the `react-native-edge-to-edge` plugin.

## State Management & Data Flow

### Chat Flow
1. **Chat Creation**: StorageService creates new chat with UUID, saves to AsyncStorage
2. **Message Sending**: User message saved immediately, assistant placeholder created with "sending" status  
3. **DNS Query**: MockDNSService (or DNSService) processes the user message
4. **Response Handling**: Assistant message updated with response content and "sent" status
5. **Auto-titling**: First user message becomes chat title (truncated to 50 chars)

### Storage Structure
- **Storage Key**: `@chat_dns_chats` in AsyncStorage
- **Date Serialization**: Automatic ISO string conversion for dates
- **Error Recovery**: Storage operations include error handling and fallback to empty arrays

## Native DNS Implementation (v1.5.4+) - PRODUCTION READY ✅

### 🎯 FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Native iOS & Android Enhanced

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** - Native DNS implementation now works perfectly on iOS, matching `dig @ch.at "message" TXT +short` functionality. Version 1.5.3 fixed critical iOS timeout issues. Version 1.5.4 enhanced Android implementation with comprehensive logging and improved packet handling.

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Recurring Native DNS Module Registration Issue - PERMANENT FIX

**Problem**: Native DNS module fails to register with React Native bridge, showing:
```
✅ RNDNSModule found: false
🔍 NATIVE: Platform: web
❌ NATIVE: Native DNS not available or doesn't support custom servers
```

**Root Cause**: DNSNative pod not included in iOS Podfile after fresh installs or CocoaPods updates.

**🔧 PERMANENT SOLUTION**: Always verify DNSNative pod registration in iOS Podfile:

```ruby
# Native DNS Module - REQUIRED for iOS native DNS functionality
pod 'DNSNative', :path => './DNSNative'
```

**⚠️ Critical Steps After Any CocoaPods Changes:**

1. **Verify Podfile Entry**: Check that DNSNative pod is included in `ios/Podfile`
2. **Fix Podspec Path**: Ensure `ios/DNSNative/DNSNative.podspec` has correct package.json path:
   ```ruby
   package = JSON.parse(File.read(File.join(__dir__, "../../package.json")))
   ```
3. **Reinstall Pods**: Run `cd ios && pod install` to register the module
4. **Rebuild**: Run `npm run ios` to compile with native module

**🔍 Verification Commands:**
```bash
# Check if DNSNative pod is listed
grep -A 2 -B 2 "DNSNative" ios/Podfile.lock

# Verify native module files exist
ls -la ios/DNSNative/

# Check for successful pod installation
cd ios && pod install | grep "Installing DNSNative"
```

**This issue recurs when:**
- Switching git branches with different Podfile configurations
- Running `pod install` without DNSNative entry in Podfile
- Fresh project setups or clean installs
- CocoaPods cache clears or updates

### Native Platform Implementation

- **✅ iOS Implementation**: Complete Swift implementation using Apple Network Framework
- **Direct UDP DNS**: Queries `ch.at:53` directly via UDP socket
  - **Manual DNS Packets**: Creates and parses DNS packets for maximum compatibility
  - **Message-as-Domain**: Treats user message as DNS query domain (exactly like dig)
  - **Network Framework**: Uses `NWConnection` with proper async/await patterns
  - **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive debug output for monitoring and troubleshooting

- **✅ Android Implementation**: Complete implementation synchronized with iOS behavior
  - **Modern (API 29+)**: Android DnsResolver API with proper error handling
  - **Legacy (API <29)**: dnsjava library integration with comprehensive support
  - **Message Sanitization**: Identical to iOS (spaces→dashes, lowercase, 200 char limit)
  - **Query Deduplication**: ConcurrentHashMap-based duplicate prevention
  - **Structured Errors**: DNSError class matching iOS error types and formats
  - **Java 17 Compatible**: Fixed Record class conflicts with fully qualified names

### ✅ Production Test Results

**iOS Native DNS Console Output:**
```
🔧 NativeDNS constructor called
✅ RNDNSModule found: true
🔍 Native DNS capabilities received: {
  "available": true,
  "supportsCustomServer": true,
  "supportsAsyncQuery": true,
  "platform": "ios"
}
✅ Native DNS reports as available!
🌐 Querying ch.at with message: "What's the meaning of life?"
📥 Raw TXT records received: ["The meaning of life is a personal and philosophical question..."]
🎉 Native DNS query successful
```

### Technical Implementation Status

- **✅ iOS Swift Module**: Complete implementation with manual DNS packet handling
- **✅ TypeScript Interface**: Full compatibility with React Native bridge
- **✅ CocoaPods Integration**: Proper podspec configuration and native dependency management
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with timeout management
- **✅ Fallback Chain**: Seamless integration with existing UDP/TCP/HTTPS fallbacks

### Configuration Status - COMPLETE

- **✅ Bundle IDs**: Production identifiers (`org.mvneves.dnschat`)
- **✅ Version Sync**: app.json and package.json at v1.6.1
- **✅ Package Metadata**: Complete podspec dependencies resolved
- **✅ Build Process**: iOS builds successfully with native DNS module
- **✅ Module Registration**: Native module properly detected by React Native bridge

## Debugging Native DNS Issues

When working on native DNS problems:
1. **Test with CLI first**: Use `node test-dns.js "message"` to verify DNS service connectivity
2. **Check platform capabilities**: Use `nativeDNS.isAvailable()` to verify native module status
3. **iOS debugging**: Monitor Network Framework usage in Xcode console
4. **Android debugging**: Check API level support and dnsjava fallback behavior
5. **Fallback chain testing**: Verify graceful degradation through all fallback layers

## Network Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Network Issues and Solutions

#### 1. UDP Port 53 Blocked (ERR_SOCKET_BAD_PORT on iOS)
- **Symptoms**: UDP DNS queries fail with port/BAD_PORT errors
- **Solution**: App automatically falls back to DNS-over-TCP
- **Manual fix**: Ensure `react-native-tcp-socket` is installed
- **Networks affected**: Some cellular networks, corporate Wi-Fi, public hotspots

#### 2. iOS App Transport Security (ATS) Issues
- **Symptoms**: Network requests blocked by ATS
- **Solution**: Configured exceptions in `ios/ChatDNS/Info.plist` (iOS project structure)
- **Coverage**: 
  - `ch.at` - allows insecure loads for DNS queries
  - `llm.pieter.com` - allows insecure loads for DNS queries
  - `cloudflare-dns.com` - secure HTTPS for DNS-over-HTTPS fallback

#### 3. Background App Suspension
- **Symptoms**: DNS queries fail when app returns from background
- **Solution**: Automatic app state monitoring and query suspension
- **Behavior**: Queries suspend in background, resume in foreground
- **Error messages**: "DNS query suspended due to app backgrounding"

#### 4. React Native AbortSignal Compatibility
- **Symptoms**: "AbortSignal.timeout is not a function" errors
- **Solution**: Custom AbortController + setTimeout implementation
- **Impact**: Affects DNS-over-HTTPS timeout handling

#### 5. Native Module Registration Issues
- **Symptoms**: "Native DNS not available, falling back to legacy methods"
- **iOS Solution**: Run `cd ios && pod install` to register native modules
- **Android Solution**: Clean and rebuild with `expo run:android`
- **Verification**: Check `nativeDNS.isAvailable()` returns `available: true`

#### 6. Android Build Issues
- **Java 24 Compatibility Error**: "Unsupported class file major version 68"
  - **Solution**: Use Java 17 - `npm run android` (automatically uses Java 17)
  - **Manual**: `JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home npm run android`
- **react-native-reanimated Gradle Error**: "Could not create task ':react-native-reanimated:outgoingVariants'"
  - **Solution**: Project uses Gradle 8.10.2 for compatibility
  - **Clear caches**: `rm -rf ~/.gradle/caches && rm -rf android/.gradle`
- **Build Environment**: Install Java 17 with `brew install openjdk@17`

### Network Testing Commands

```bash
# Test DNS connectivity directly
node test-dns.js "Hello world"

# Test native module integration (in React Native app)
await nativeDNS.isAvailable()

# Test fallback chain
# 1. Native -> 2. UDP -> 3. TCP -> 4. HTTPS -> 5. Mock

# iOS build with native modules
cd ios && pod install && cd .. && npm run ios

# Android build with native modules  
npm run android
```
