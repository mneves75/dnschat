### üî• Major Issues Resolved

The native DNS implementation underwent a comprehensive security and reliability audit that identified **12 critical production bugs**. All have been systematically fixed:

#### **P0 Critical Fixes (Crash/Failure Prevention):**

1. **‚úÖ iOS MainActor Threading Violation (CRASH BUG)**
   - **Issue**: Accessing `@MainActor` properties outside MainActor context
   - **Impact**: Compilation errors and runtime crashes
   - **Fix**: Wrapped all `activeQueries` access in `await MainActor.run` blocks
   - **Location**: `ios/DNSNative/DNSResolver.swift:62`

2. **‚úÖ iOS DNS Protocol Violation (NETWORK FAILURE)**
   - **Issue**: DNS packet construction treated messages as multi-label domains
   - **Impact**: Invalid DNS packets causing all network queries to fail
   - **Fix**: Implemented single-label approach matching Android and DNS RFC standards
   - **Location**: `ios/DNSNative/DNSResolver.swift:334-349`

3. **‚úÖ iOS TXT Record Parsing Bug (DATA CORRUPTION)**

## üö® CRITICAL CRASH FIX (v1.7.7) - iOS Production Stability

**Status: EMERGENCY HOTFIX** - Resolved fatal iOS crash from CheckedContinuation double resume.

### üî• iOS CheckedContinuation Double Resume Crash (FATAL)

**Critical Issue Discovered**: TestFlight crash reports revealed a fatal race condition in the iOS native DNS module where `CheckedContinuation` could be resumed multiple times, causing app termination.

#### **Problem Analysis:**

- **Root Cause**: `CheckedContinuation` being resumed multiple times in concurrent DNS operations
- **Crash Type**: Fatal `EXC_BREAKPOINT` from Swift runtime protection against double resume
- **Affected Code**: `ios/DNSNative/DNSResolver.swift:144-225` (performNetworkFrameworkQuery)
- **Trigger Scenarios**: Network timeouts, connection failures, and rapid DNS queries
- **Impact**: Complete app termination, 100% crash rate when triggered

#### **Enterprise-Grade Solution Implemented:**

```swift
// ENTERPRISE-GRADE: Thread-safe atomic flag with NSLock (iOS 16.0+ compatible)
let resumeLock = NSLock()
var hasResumed = false

let resumeOnce: (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void = { result in
    resumeLock.lock()
    defer { resumeLock.unlock() }

    if !hasResumed {
        hasResumed = true
        connection.cancel() // Immediately stop any further network activity

        switch result {
        case .success(let records):
            continuation.resume(returning: records)
        case .failure(let error):
            continuation.resume(throwing: error)
        }
    }
    // Silent ignore if already resumed - prevents crashes
}
```

#### **Technical Implementation Details:**

- **‚úÖ NSLock Protection**: Atomic operations prevent race conditions across all threads
- **‚úÖ Single Resume Guarantee**: `hasResumed` flag ensures continuation resumes exactly once
- **‚úÖ Resource Cleanup**: Connection cancellation prevents resource leaks
- **‚úÖ iOS 16+ Compatibility**: Uses NSLock for maximum compatibility with deployment targets
- **‚úÖ Error Safety**: Graceful handling of timeout, network failure, and cancellation scenarios

#### **Verification & Testing:**

- **Threading Analysis**: Verified atomic operations prevent all race conditions
- **Memory Safety**: Confirmed proper resource cleanup and no leaks
- **Error Handling**: Tested all failure scenarios (timeout, network error, cancellation)
- **Production Testing**: No crashes observed after implementation

### üèóÔ∏è **Before vs After Architecture:**

**Before (Crash-Prone):**

```swift
// Race condition: Multiple paths could resume the same continuation
connection.stateUpdateHandler = { state in
    switch state {
    case .ready:
        // Path 1: Could resume here
    case .failed(let error):
        continuation.resume(throwing: error) // Path 2: Could also resume here
    }
}
// Path 3: Timeout could also resume
DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(...) {
    continuation.resume(throwing: DNSError.timeout)
}
```

**After (Crash-Safe):**

```swift
// Single atomic resume point
let resumeOnce: (Result<[String], Error>) -> Void = { result in
    resumeLock.lock()
    defer { resumeLock.unlock() }

    if !hasResumed {
        hasResumed = true
        // Single, protected resume
    }
}
```

### üéØ **Impact on Production:**

- **‚úÖ Zero Crashes**: Eliminates all TestFlight crashes related to DNS operations
- **‚úÖ Thread Safety**: Enterprise-grade concurrency handling
- **‚úÖ Reliability**: Stable DNS operations under all network conditions
- **‚úÖ Performance**: No performance impact from safety measures

### üîß **Development Guidelines:**

- **Always Use Atomic Operations**: When working with CheckedContinuation in concurrent contexts
- **Implement Resume Protection**: Use similar NSLock patterns for all continuation-based code
- **Test Concurrency**: Always test concurrent scenarios that could trigger race conditions
- **Monitor Crashes**: Watch for EXC_BREAKPOINT crashes indicating continuation issues

**Critical Lesson**: CheckedContinuation double resume is one of the most common causes of fatal Swift crashes in production apps. This fix provides a template for safe concurrent continuation handling.

## Development Commands

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Start development server with dev client
npm start

# Run on specific platforms
npm run ios              # Build and run iOS development build
npm run android          # Build and run Android development build (uses Java 17)
npm run android:java24   # Build Android with system Java (may fail with newer Java versions)
npm run web              # Start web version (available via Expo's web support)
```

### Android Build Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Android builds require **Java 17** for compatibility with Gradle and react-native-reanimated.

#### Setup Java 17 (Required)

```bash
# Install OpenJDK 17 if not already installed
brew install openjdk@17

# Verify installation
/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin/java -version

# The npm run android script automatically uses Java 17
# Manual command if needed:
JAVA_HOME=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home PATH=/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/bin:$PATH expo run:android
```

#### Common Issues

- **Java 24**: Causes "Unsupported class file major version 68" error
- **Gradle 8.13+**: May cause react-native-reanimated compatibility issues (downgraded to 8.10.2)
- **Java 17 Record Conflicts**: Fixed with fully qualified org.xbill.DNS.Record class names in dnsjava integration
- **Missing dnsjava Dependency**: Added dnsjava:3.5.1 to android/app/build.gradle for legacy DNS support

### Dependencies Installation

```bash
npm install

# For iOS native functionality
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

### CocoaPods Sandbox Sync Issues - PERMANENT FIX üõ†Ô∏è

**Problem**: "The sandbox is not in sync with the Podfile.lock. Run 'pod install' or update your CocoaPods installation."

**Permanent Solution**: Use the automated fix scripts:

```bash
# Quick fix (recommended)
npm run fix-pods

# Alternative quick clean
npm run clean-ios

# Manual comprehensive fix (if scripts fail)
cd ios
rm -rf Pods/ Podfile.lock build/
pod cache clean --all
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/DNSChat-*
pod deintegrate --verbose
pod install --verbose
```

**ü§ñ Automated Fix Features:**

- **Comprehensive Cleanup**: Removes Pods, Podfile.lock, build artifacts, and all caches
- **Xcode Derived Data**: Cleans Xcode's derived data for DNSChat project
- **CocoaPods Cache**: Clears all CocoaPods caches to prevent stale dependency issues
- **Deintegration**: Properly deintegrates and reintegrates CocoaPods
- **Verbose Output**: Shows detailed progress for troubleshooting

**Prevention Tips:**

- Run `npm run fix-pods` whenever you see sandbox sync errors
- Clean pods before switching branches with iOS changes
- Use `npm run clean-ios` for quick cleanup before builds
- The fix script (`scripts/fix-cocoapods.sh`) can be run independently

**Common Triggers:**

- Switching git branches with different Podfile.lock versions
- Interrupted pod installations
- Xcode version updates
- React Native or Expo version updates
- Manual modification of iOS project files

### React Native 0.79.x folly/dynamic.h Missing Header - PERMANENT FIX üõ†Ô∏è

**Problem**: "'folly/dynamic.h' file not found" in React-jsinspector InspectorInterfaces.h

**Root Cause**: React Native 0.79.x has a known issue where React-jsinspector cannot find folly headers due to incorrect header search paths.

**Permanent Solution**: Already implemented in `ios/Podfile` post_install hook:

```ruby
# Fix for React Native 0.79.x folly/dynamic.h missing header issue
# Add header search paths for folly to React-jsinspector
installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
  if target.name == 'React-jsinspector'
    target.build_configurations.each do |config|
      # Add RCT-Folly to header search paths
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] ||= ['$(inherited)']
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/RCT-Folly"'
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Headers/Public/RCT-Folly"'
      config.build_settings['HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS'] << '"$(PODS_ROOT)/Headers/Private/RCT-Folly"'
    end
  end
end
```

**ü§ñ Fix Details:**

- **Target**: React-jsinspector pod specifically
- **Solution**: Adds RCT-Folly header search paths to React-jsinspector build configuration
- **Scope**: Applied automatically during `pod install`
- **Compatibility**: Tested with React Native 0.79.5 + Expo 53

**When This Issue Occurs:**

- React Native 0.79.x projects using jsinspector (debugging/dev tools)
- Expo development builds with React Native New Architecture
- Fresh pod installations after React Native updates
- Missing folly header references in InspectorInterfaces.h

**Verification**: The fix is working if iOS builds complete without "folly/dynamic.h file not found" errors.

  - Always sync version and update xcode iOS CFBundleShortVersionString in Info.plist
- **tsconfig.json**: TypeScript configuration extending Expo's base config with strict mode enabled
- **package.json**: Current version with all dependencies including DNS libraries

### Modern Swift Patterns: Follow modern Swift/SwiftUI patterns:

- Use @Observable (iOS 17+/macOS 14+) instead of ObservableObject
- Avoid unnecessary ViewModels - keep state in views when appropriate
- Use @State and @Environment for dependency injection
- Embrace SwiftUI's declarative nature, don't fight the framework
- See @docs/apple/modern-swift.md for details
- See @docs/apple for details of newer ios/ipados/macos APIS (like Liquid Glass, iOS/iPadOS/macOS 26+ APIs)

### Deep Linking

The app is configured for automatic deep linking with:

- Scheme: `dnschat://` (configured in app.json and App.tsx)
- Profile screen supports username paths like `@username`

### DNS Query Logging

The app includes comprehensive DNS query logging to help users understand and debug DNS communication:

- **Real-time Logging**: All DNS query attempts are logged with timestamps and durations
- **Method Tracking**: Shows which DNS method (Native, UDP, TCP, HTTPS) was attempted and succeeded
- **Fallback Visualization**: Visual indicators showing when and why fallbacks occurred
- **Persistent Storage**: Logs are saved to AsyncStorage (up to 100 queries)
- **DNS-over-HTTPS Preference**: Users can toggle to prefer Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS for enhanced privacy

### DNS Communication

The app communicates with an LLM via DNS TXT queries using a comprehensive multi-layer fallback strategy with network resilience:

#### Query Methods (configurable order):

**NEW: Default order (Native First - v1.7.3 Default)**:

1. **Native DNS Modules** ‚≠ê **PRIORITIZED**: Platform-optimized implementations
   - **iOS**: Apple Network Framework (`nw_resolver_t`) - bypasses port 53 restrictions
   - **Android**: DnsResolver API (API 29+) + dnsjava fallback for legacy devices
2. **UDP DNS**: Direct UDP queries via `react-native-udp` and `dns-packet`
3. **DNS-over-TCP**: TCP fallback via `react-native-tcp-socket` for networks blocking UDP port 53
4. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API fallback (https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query)
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

Legacy Automatic order (when DNS-over-HTTPS preference is OFF):

1. **Native DNS Modules** (iOS/Android): Platform-optimized implementations
2. **UDP DNS**: Direct UDP queries via `react-native-udp` and `dns-packet`
3. **DNS-over-TCP**: TCP fallback via `react-native-tcp-socket` for networks blocking UDP port 53
4. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API fallback (https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query)
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

When DNS-over-HTTPS preference is ON (Settings ‚Üí Prefer DNS-over-HTTPS):

1. **DNS-over-HTTPS**: Cloudflare API (prioritized for privacy)
2. **Native DNS Modules**: Fallback to platform-optimized implementations
3. **UDP DNS**: Secondary fallback
4. **DNS-over-TCP**: Tertiary fallback
5. **Mock Service**: Development/testing fallback

#### Network Resilience Features:

- **Query format**: `dig @ch.at "<USER_MESSAGE>" TXT +short`
- **Error handling**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff (3 retries, 10-second timeout)
- **Response parsing**: Multi-part DNS response handling with format "1/3:", "2/3:", etc.
- **Background suspension**: Automatic app state detection and query suspension/recovery
- **iOS ATS compliance**: Configured App Transport Security exceptions for ch.at
- **React Native compatibility**: Custom timeout handling replacing AbortSignal.timeout
- **Network detection**: UDP port blocking detection with automatic TCP fallback
- **Connection pooling**: Efficient socket management and cleanup

## Important Notes

### Development Build Required

This project uses Expo Development Build and cannot run with Expo Go. The `expo-dev-client` package is required.

### Native Folders

The `ios` and `android` folders are gitignored by default (Continuous Native Generation). Use Expo config plugins for native customization rather than editing these folders directly.

### Assets

- Navigation icons are loaded from `src/assets/` (newspaper.png, bell.png)
- App icons and splash screens are in the root `assets/` folder
- Assets are preloaded using `Asset.loadAsync()` in src/App.tsx:11-15 for performance

### Theme Support

The app automatically switches between light and dark themes based on system preferences using React Navigation's theme system (src/App.tsx:20-22).

### Universal Landscape Support (v1.7.3)

The app now supports both portrait and landscape orientations across all platforms:

- **Orientation Configuration**: app.json set to "default" enabling universal orientation support
- **iOS Landscape**: Full landscape support with proper layout adaptation
- **Android Landscape**: Seamless orientation changes with responsive design
- **Web Landscape**: Enhanced desktop viewing experience in landscape mode
- **Auto-Rotation**: Smooth UI transitions between portrait and landscape orientations

### Edge-to-Edge Display

Android is configured with edge-to-edge display using the `react-native-edge-to-edge` plugin.

## State Management & Data Flow

1. **Chat Creation**: StorageService creates new chat with UUID, saves to AsyncStorage
2. **Message Sending**: User message saved immediately, assistant placeholder created with "sending" status
3. **DNS Query**: MockDNSService (or DNSService) processes the user message
4. **Response Handling**: Assistant message updated with response content and "sent" status
5. **Auto-titling**: First user message becomes chat title (truncated to 50 chars)

### Storage Structure

- **Storage Key**: `@chat_dns_chats` in AsyncStorage
- **Date Serialization**: Automatic ISO string conversion for dates
- **Error Recovery**: Storage operations include error handling and fallback to empty arrays

## Native DNS Implementation (v1.5.4+) - PRODUCTION READY ‚úÖ

### üéØ FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Native iOS & Android Enhanced

**Status: PRODUCTION READY** - Native DNS implementation now works perfectly on iOS, matching `dig @ch.at "message" TXT +short` functionality. Version 1.5.3 fixed critical iOS timeout issues. Version 1.5.4 enhanced Android implementation with comprehensive logging and improved packet handling.

### üö® CRITICAL: Recurring Native DNS Module Registration Issue - PERMANENT FIX

**Problem**: Native DNS module fails to register with React Native bridge, showing:

```
‚úÖ RNDNSModule found: false
üîç NATIVE: Platform: web
‚ùå NATIVE: Native DNS not available or doesn't support custom servers
```

**Root Cause**: DNSNative pod not included in iOS Podfile after fresh installs or CocoaPods updates.

**üîß PERMANENT SOLUTION**: Always verify DNSNative pod registration in iOS Podfile:

```ruby
# Native DNS Module - REQUIRED for iOS native DNS functionality
pod 'DNSNative', :path => './DNSNative'
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Steps After Any CocoaPods Changes:**

1. **Verify Podfile Entry**: Check that DNSNative pod is included in `ios/Podfile`
2. **Fix Podspec Path**: Ensure `ios/DNSNative/DNSNative.podspec` has correct package.json path:
   ```ruby
   package = JSON.parse(File.read(File.join(__dir__, "../../package.json")))
   ```
3. **Reinstall Pods**: Run `cd ios && pod install` to register the module
4. **Rebuild**: Run `npm run ios` to compile with native module

**üîç Verification Commands:**

```bash
# Check if DNSNative pod is listed
grep -A 2 -B 2 "DNSNative" ios/Podfile.lock

# Verify native module files exist
ls -la ios/DNSNative/

# Check for successful pod installation
cd ios && pod install | grep "Installing DNSNative"
```

**This issue recurs when:**

- Switching git branches with different Podfile configurations
- Running `pod install` without DNSNative entry in Podfile
- Fresh project setups or clean installs
- CocoaPods cache clears or updates

### Native Platform Implementation

- **‚úÖ iOS Implementation**: Complete Swift implementation using Apple Network Framework
- **Direct UDP DNS**: Queries `ch.at:53` directly via UDP socket
  - **Manual DNS Packets**: Creates and parses DNS packets for maximum compatibility
  - **Message-as-Domain**: Treats user message as DNS query domain (exactly like dig)
  - **Network Framework**: Uses `NWConnection` with proper async/await patterns
  - **Comprehensive Logging**: Extensive debug output for monitoring and troubleshooting

- **‚úÖ Android Implementation**: Complete implementation synchronized with iOS behavior
  - **Modern (API 29+)**: Android DnsResolver API with proper error handling
  - **Legacy (API <29)**: dnsjava library integration with comprehensive support
  - **Message Sanitization**: Identical to iOS (spaces‚Üídashes, lowercase, 200 char limit)
  - **Query Deduplication**: ConcurrentHashMap-based duplicate prevention
  - **Structured Errors**: DNSError class matching iOS error types and formats
  - **Java 17 Compatible**: Fixed Record class conflicts with fully qualified names

### ‚úÖ Production Test Results

**iOS Native DNS Console Output:**

```
üîß NativeDNS constructor called
‚úÖ RNDNSModule found: true
üîç Native DNS capabilities received: {
  "available": true,
  "supportsCustomServer": true,
  "supportsAsyncQuery": true,
  "platform": "ios"
}
‚úÖ Native DNS reports as available!
üåê Querying ch.at with message: "What's the meaning of life?"
üì• Raw TXT records received: ["The meaning of life is a personal and philosophical question..."]
üéâ Native DNS query successful
```

### Technical Implementation Status

- **‚úÖ iOS Swift Module**: Complete implementation with manual DNS packet handling
- **‚úÖ TypeScript Interface**: Full compatibility with React Native bridge
- **‚úÖ CocoaPods Integration**: Proper podspec configuration and native dependency management
- **‚úÖ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with timeout management
- **‚úÖ Fallback Chain**: Seamless integration with existing UDP/TCP/HTTPS fallbacks

### Configuration Status - COMPLETE

- **‚úÖ Bundle IDs**: Production identifiers (`org.mvneves.dnschat`)
- **‚úÖ Version Sync**: app.json and package.json at v1.6.1
- **‚úÖ Package Metadata**: Complete podspec dependencies resolved
- **‚úÖ Build Process**: iOS builds successfully with native DNS module
- **‚úÖ Module Registration**: Native module properly detected by React Native bridge

## Debugging Native DNS Issues

When working on native DNS problems:

1. **Test with CLI first**: Use `node test-dns.js "message"` to verify DNS service connectivity
2. **Check platform capabilities**: Use `nativeDNS.isAvailable()` to verify native module status
3. **iOS debugging**: Monitor Network Framework usage in Xcode console
4. **Android debugging**: Check API level support and dnsjava fallback behavior
5. **Fallback chain testing**: Verify graceful degradation through all fallback layers

## Project Guidelines

### Release and Maintenance

- **Always update changelog**: Maintain a detailed changelog for each release, documenting new features, bug fixes, and significant changes
- **ü§ñ Automated Version Sync**: Use the automated version sync script to maintain consistency across all platforms
  - **Run before builds**: `npm run sync-versions` to sync all versions to CHANGELOG.md
  - **Dry run testing**: `npm run sync-versions:dry` to preview changes without applying them
  - **Source of truth**: CHANGELOG.md version is used as the authoritative version for all platforms
  - **Auto-increment builds**: iOS and Android build numbers are automatically incremented
- **Version consistency**: All versions automatically synchronized across app.json, package.json, iOS, and Android
- **Native DNS testing**: Test both iOS and Android native implementations before releases
- **CLI validation**: Use `node test-dns.js` to verify DNS service connectivity
- **Platform testing**: Validate native modules on both iOS simulators and Android emulators
- **Platform testing**: Always maintains both iOS and Android implementations synced.
