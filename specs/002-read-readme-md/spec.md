   ‚Üí Actions: send messages, receive responses, view logs, configure settings
   ‚Üí Data: chat messages, conversation history, DNS queries, settings
   ‚Üí Constraints: DNS protocol limitations, network reliability, mobile platform requirements
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Performance requirements specified based on production usage
   ‚Üí Security requirements defined from v2.0.1 fixes
   ‚Üí Multi-platform consistency ensured through existing codebase
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: user sends message ‚Üí DNS query ‚Üí AI response
   ‚Üí Edge cases: network failures, fallback mechanisms, rate limiting
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí 15 testable requirements covering core functionality
   ‚Üí Security, performance, and platform requirements included
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Chat messages, DNS queries, user settings, conversation history
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and measurable
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A mobile user wants to chat with AI models using their phone's internet connection. Instead of using traditional chat APIs, they send messages through DNS infrastructure for enhanced privacy and network resilience. The app converts their natural language messages into DNS queries, sends them to AI-enabled DNS servers (like ch.at), and displays the AI responses in a familiar chat interface.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the app is open on a mobile device, **When** user types "What is the weather like?" and taps send, **Then** the message appears in chat history and an AI response is received within 10 seconds
2. **Given** the primary DNS method fails, **When** user sends a message, **Then** the app automatically tries fallback methods and successfully delivers the message
3. **Given** user is on a restricted network, **When** they attempt to send a message, **Then** the app tries multiple DNS transport methods (UDP, TCP, HTTPS) until one succeeds
4. **Given** user wants to review their activity, **When** they open the logs section, **Then** they can see detailed information about DNS queries, response times, and fallback attempts
5. **Given** user wants to customize their experience, **When** they access settings, **Then** they can configure DNS servers, transport methods, and app behavior

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all DNS methods fail? System shows error message and queues message for retry
- How does system handle rate limiting? App displays wait time and prevents spam
- What occurs during network switching (WiFi to cellular)? App automatically retries with new connection
- How does app behave when backgrounded during query? Queries pause and resume when app returns to foreground
- What happens with malformed user input? System sanitizes input to prevent DNS injection attacks

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to send text messages through DNS TXT queries to AI services
- **FR-002**: System MUST display AI responses in a conversational chat interface with message history
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement automatic fallback between multiple DNS transport methods (native, UDP, TCP, HTTPS)
- **FR-004**: System MUST sanitize user input to prevent DNS injection attacks and ensure DNS-safe queries
- **FR-005**: System MUST support cross-platform deployment on iOS 16+ and Android API 21+ devices
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist conversation history locally on the device using encrypted storage with indefinite retention until user manually deletes
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide real-time logging of DNS queries, response times, and fallback attempts with 30-day retention maximum
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to configure DNS server preferences and transport method priorities
- **FR-009**: System MUST implement rate limiting with maximum 60 messages per minute to prevent abuse and respect server limits
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle network transitions (WiFi to cellular) gracefully without losing messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST support both light and dark themes with automatic system preference detection
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide accessibility features compliant with platform guidelines
- **FR-013**: System MUST respond to DNS queries within 10 seconds under normal network conditions
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain conversation state when app is backgrounded and resumed
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate DNS server whitelist to only allow pre-approved servers and block all custom server additions

### Performance Requirements
- **PR-001**: App MUST launch and be ready for user input within 3 seconds
- **PR-002**: DNS queries MUST complete within 10 seconds or trigger fallback methods
- **PR-003**: Chat interface MUST remain responsive during DNS operations
- **PR-004**: Local storage operations MUST complete within 1 second

### Security Requirements
- **SR-001**: System MUST never transmit sensitive personal information through DNS queries
- **SR-002**: System MUST implement thread-safe operations to prevent race conditions
- **SR-003**: System MUST properly manage network resources to prevent memory leaks
- **SR-004**: System MUST validate all user input before processing DNS queries

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Message**: Represents user input and AI responses with timestamp, content, and delivery status
- **DNS Query Log**: Records query details including method used, response time, success/failure status with automatic 30-day retention
- **User Settings**: Stores user preferences for DNS servers, transport methods, and app configuration
- **Conversation History**: Maintains persistent record of chat sessions with encryption for privacy

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-28
- Q: Should the app allow custom DNS servers beyond the whitelist? ‚Üí A: Block all custom servers - only pre-approved servers allowed
- Q: How long should conversation history be retained locally? ‚Üí A: Until user manually deletes - indefinite retention with user control
- Q: What should be the maximum messages per minute to prevent abuse? ‚Üí A: 60 messages per minute - liberal limit for power users
- Q: How long should DNS query logs be retained? ‚Üí A: 30 days maximum - monthly retention for analysis
