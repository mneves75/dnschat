# Research Findings: DNSChat Implementation

**Date**: 2025-09-28
**Feature**: DNS-Based AI Communication App

## Technical Decisions

### React Native Framework
**Decision**: React Native 0.81.4 with Expo SDK 54
**Rationale**:
- Existing codebase already established with this stack
- Cross-platform deployment to iOS 16+ and Android API 21+
- Expo Router v6 provides file-based navigation
- Strong ecosystem for mobile-specific requirements

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Flutter (rejected: team expertise in React Native)
- Native development (rejected: code duplication, slower development)

### DNS Implementation Strategy
**Decision**: Multi-method fallback with native modules priority
**Rationale**:
- Native iOS Network Framework and Android DnsResolver provide optimal performance
- UDP/TCP fallbacks ensure compatibility with restricted networks
- DoH provides final fallback for maximum reach
- Existing production-tested implementation available

**Alternatives Considered**:
- DoH-only approach (rejected: slower, blocked by some networks)
- UDP-only approach (rejected: fails on corporate networks)

### State Management
**Decision**: Hybrid Zustand + React Context approach
**Rationale**:
- Zustand for local component state and chat data
- React Context for global app state and settings
- Existing pattern in codebase with proven stability
- TypeScript integration excellent

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Redux Toolkit (rejected: overkill for this app size)
- Context-only (rejected: performance concerns for chat history)

### Storage Strategy
**Decision**: AsyncStorage with encryption for conversation history, separate retention policies
**Rationale**:
- AsyncStorage native to React Native, good performance
- Encryption layer protects user privacy
- Separate 30-day retention for logs vs indefinite for conversations
- Existing implementation patterns available

**Alternatives Considered**:
- SQLite (rejected: added complexity, not needed for key-value storage)
- Unencrypted storage (rejected: privacy requirements)

### UI Framework
**Decision**: React Native built-in components with Liquid Glass system
**Rationale**:
- iOS 26+ Liquid Glass provides modern, native-feeling UI
- Comprehensive fallbacks for older devices
- Maintains platform consistency
- Existing design system in place

**Alternatives Considered**:
- NativeBase (rejected: overhead, styling conflicts)
- React Native Elements (rejected: outdated design patterns)

### Testing Strategy
**Decision**: Jest with TypeScript, native module testing, integration tests
**Rationale**:
- Jest integrates well with React Native and TypeScript
- Can test native module bridges effectively
- Integration tests validate DNS fallback logic
- Existing test infrastructure available

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Detox for E2E (deferred: not needed for current scope)
- React Native Testing Library only (rejected: insufficient for native modules)

## Architecture Patterns

### DNS Service Architecture
**Decision**: Service layer with adapter pattern for DNS methods
**Rationale**:
- Clean separation between DNS implementations
- Easy to add/remove DNS methods
- Consistent error handling across methods
- Testable in isolation

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
**Rationale**:
- DNS failures are expected in mobile environments
- Users need visibility into what's happening
- Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- Queue messages during extended outages

### Security Implementation
**Decision**: Input sanitization, DNS injection prevention, encrypted storage
**Rationale**:
- DNS protocol has inherent security limitations
- User input validation critical for preventing attacks
- Encrypted local storage protects user privacy
- Rate limiting prevents abuse

## Implementation Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: iOS CheckedContinuation Crash
**Mitigation**: Implement atomic flag to prevent double resume in Swift DNS resolver

### Risk: Cross-platform DNS inconsistencies
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite with platform-specific validation

### Risk: Network reliability in mobile environments
**Mitigation**: Robust fallback chain, offline message queuing, connection state management

## Performance Considerations

### App Launch Performance
**Target**: 3 seconds to interactive
**Strategy**: Lazy loading of DNS services, minimal startup dependencies

### DNS Query Performance
**Target**: 10 seconds timeout with fallback
**Strategy**: Parallel query attempts, caching of successful servers

### Memory Management
**Strategy**: 30-day log retention, efficient message storage, proper cleanup of network resources

## Dependencies Analysis

### Critical Dependencies
- `expo`: Core framework - stable, well-maintained
- `react-native`: Platform foundation - LTS version chosen
- `dns-packet`: DNS query construction - production-tested
- `zustand`: State management - lightweight, TypeScript-native

### Native Dependencies
- iOS Network Framework: System-provided, stable
- Android DnsResolver: API 29+, dnsjava fallback for older versions

### Development Dependencies
- `typescript`: Strict mode enabled for type safety
- `jest`: Comprehensive testing framework
- `@types/*`: Full TypeScript coverage

## Conclusion

All technical research complete. No NEEDS CLARIFICATION items remain. The existing codebase provides a solid foundation with proven patterns for DNS-based communication, mobile UI, and cross-platform deployment. Implementation can proceed directly to design phase.
